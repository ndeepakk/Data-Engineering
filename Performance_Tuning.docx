Data Loading 


When it comes to data loading, you can employ the following practice for Snowflake performance tuning, as outlined below:

Split Files during the Data Loading process: Snowflake employs a multi-cluster and multi-threading architecture. This means that data, once loaded, is processed by several nodes in the software. Therefore, it is best to break down your file into several small chunks for them to be handled by different nodes, which will boost speed and efficiency. However, if you choose to upload one large file, you will only be using one node regardless of having a large warehouse. The same case applies to unloading data as well.
