__Data Loading__


When it comes to data loading, you can employ the following practice for Snowflake performance tuning, as outlined below:

Split Files during the Data Loading process: Snowflake employs a multi-cluster and multi-threading architecture. This means that data, once loaded, is processed by several nodes in the software. Therefore, it is best to break down your file into several small chunks for them to be handled by different nodes, which will boost speed and efficiency. However, if you choose to upload one large file, you will only be using one node regardless of having a large warehouse. The same case applies to unloading data as well. 

__Data Design__

This primarily applies to Data Storage. You can adopt the following recommendations for Snowflake performance tuning to boost Snowflake’s performance efficiency. 

__Semi-Structured Data__: When storing regular data that uses native types such as strings and integers, it is best to load them into a VARIANT column since it contains the storage and query requirements.

__Date/Time Data Types__: When defining columns for “date/time data types”, it is best to select a date or time timestamp data type instead of characters. This is because Snowflake stores the former data types more efficiently than the latter. 

__Clustering Keys__: Specifying a “cluster key” is not recommended for most tables since Snowflake does automatic tuning using the optimization engine. However, for data sets greater than 1 TB, it is best to select a cluster key. The same case applies when the query profile shows a significant amount of time is spent scanning. 

___Transient Tables___: Snowflake supports the creation of “transient tables” but does not keep a record of their history. This is a benefit since it saves on storage costs. Therefore, you can use transient tables as needed.
